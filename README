Cooler is a set of libraries made by Neuros that contain several utilities and our widget toolkit.
It is split in 2 libraries:

- 'libncooler-core.so' contains: generic shared routines for Neuros platform.
- 'libncooler-media.so' contains: the client library for our NMSD media player daemon.


To build and install library,
   make cleanall all install

The library will be installed to rootfs at $INSTALL_MOD_PATH/lib (usually neuros-bsp/rootfs/fs/lib).
The libs also go to toolchain at $TOOLCHAIN_USR_INSTALL/usr/lib (usually neuros-bsp/toolchain/arm-linux/usr/lib).
The headers will be installed into toolchain at $TOOLCHAIN_USR_INSTALL/usr/include/Neuros-Cooler/[core|neux|media].
There are also pkgconfig packages installed in $TOOLCHAIN_USR_INSTALL/usr/lib/pkgconfig.
